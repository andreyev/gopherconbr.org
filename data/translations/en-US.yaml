notice: "As GopherCon Brasil 2020 was going to be our 5th edition, we were preparing a very special one.

But 2020 and 2021 are being a completely atypical years. So after weighing all the pros and cons we decided to be guided by our desire to keep the Go community as safe as possible. We decided to postpone the fifth edition of the event to September 30th and October 1st, 2022, in the same place, the Petry Arena.

Those who have already purchased the ticket for the 2020 and 2021 edition, don’t need to worry. Those tickets are still going to be valid for the 2022 edition. If you want a refund, please contact us at info@gopherconbr.org. If you have not yet purchased the ticket, sales will remain open through Sympla.
Talks already submitted are still valid for the next event. And the submission period remains open at PaperCall.io.

Keep an eye on our social networks for news. And any questions can be sent to the email info@gopherconbr.org.
